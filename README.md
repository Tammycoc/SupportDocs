### How it works
First, you write documents using Markdown, and GitHub Pages will automatically convert them into web pages.
Then, a GitHub Action goes through all your files and compiles them into a single JSON, containing their URLs, titles, and tags.
Finally, the SupportDocs library in your app downloads the JSON and presents them in a customizable container.
