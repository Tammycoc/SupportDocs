### Deleting Documents

Select the document to delete, then just click on the trash icon in the top-right corner.

### Ordering Documents

SupportDocs sorts your documents alphabetically by filename, which is never shown to the user. You can see the order of your documents inside the **Table of Contents** section in your **DataSource** branch.
